##API

Directly embedding the API documentation as generated by _jsdoc_ will garble the entire document. Furthermore, out of the box, they really look horrible. Have a look by following these links:

* [RpcSocket](https://github.com/eriksank/rpc-websocket/blob/master/doc/api/rpc-socket.md)
* [RpcServer](https://github.com/eriksank/rpc-websocket/blob/master/doc/api/rpc-server.md)

What a nightmare!

### Socket

!DONTINCLUDE "doc/api/rpc-socket.md"
_On hold until the issues have been resolved._

### Server

!DONTINCLUDE "doc/api/rpc-server.md"
_On hold until the issues have been resolved._
